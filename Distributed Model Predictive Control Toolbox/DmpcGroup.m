classdef DmpcGroup
    % A DmpcGroup object is a representation of a coupled variable between
    % two DmpcSubsystem objects. If a variable in a DmpcSubsystem object is
    % coupled to another DmpcSubsystem object this coupling is represented
    % by the variable (in each subsystem) being a member of the same DmpcGroup
    % object.
